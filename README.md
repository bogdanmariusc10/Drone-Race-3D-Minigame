# Drone Race 3D Minigame
### Source code path: src/lab_m1/tema2
Drone Race is an immersive 3D racing game developed using OpenGL and C++. The game challenges players to navigate through an obstacle-filled course using a high-performance drone. The goal is to pass through rings that change colors as you fly through them, adding a dynamic element to the racing experience. These color-changing rings act as checkpoints, allowing players to track their progress through the race while adding complexity to the gameplay.

One of the key features of Drone Race is its advanced drone control system. The drone is controlled based on local space axes (Ox, Oy, Oz), which allows for precise maneuvers. The third-person view offers a broader perspective of the environment and the droneâ€™s movements.

The terrain in Drone Race is procedurally generated, with obstacles and dynamic landscapes that provide varying challenges in each race. The terrain is modified using noise algorithms, creating unpredictable, yet exciting environments that keep players on their toes. The use of noise adds an element of randomness, ensuring that each playthrough feels unique and engaging.

A key aspect of Drone Race is its collision detection system, which ensures that players cannot fly through obstacles. This adds a layer of realism to the game, as players must carefully maneuver their drone to avoid collisions with terrain features, walls, and other obstacles. This collision detection system creates a sense of immersion, making the game feel like a true racing experience where precision is essential.
